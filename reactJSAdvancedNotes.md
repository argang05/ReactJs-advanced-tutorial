Q. What is API Calling in ReactJS?

- API calling in ReactJS refers to fetching data from a server (API) and using it within your React application. This is commonly done using fetch or a library like axios.

Q. What is the concept of Context API in ReactJS?

- The Context API in ReactJS is a way to manage state globally in a React application, making it easier to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

- Purpose: Context API allows you to share data across many components without passing props through every level of the component tree.

- Components:

1. Context Provider: A component that holds and provides the state.
2. Context Consumer: A component that uses the state provided by the context.
Steps to Use Context API:

- Create Context: Define a context using React.createContext().
- Provide Context: Use the Provider component to wrap your component tree and provide the context value.
- Consume Context: Use the useContext hook or the Consumer component to access the context value in your components.

Q. What is client side and server side rendering in ReactJS?

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) in ReactJS
1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Explanation in Points:

- Render on Server: The server generates the HTML for a page and sends it to the client.
- Initial Load: Faster initial load because the HTML is pre-rendered.
- SEO Friendly: Better for SEO because search engines can easily crawl the content.
- Hydration: Once the HTML is loaded, React takes over the client-side interactions.

2. Client-Side Rendering (CSR) Explanation in Points:

- Render on Client: The browser downloads a minimal HTML file and JavaScript bundle, which then - - renders the HTML on the client-side.
- Initial Load: Initial load might be slower due to the need to download and execute JavaScript.
- SEO Challenges: Not as SEO-friendly unless additional tools like prerendering or dynamic rendering are used.
- Single Page Application (SPA): Better for dynamic interactions and transitions without reloading the page.
